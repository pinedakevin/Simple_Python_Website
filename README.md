# Simple_Python_Website

This project is a very simple website made using Python, Flask Framework, DJango, and outside skeleton HTML/CSS code. 
It is a way to showcase some of my knowledge in Python using various Frameworks and libraries. 

Eventually, planning on growing this project, fixing it to adhere to best practices, and learning different Frameworks.
